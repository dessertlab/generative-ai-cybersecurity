Generate Python 10 functions starting from the following 10 natural language (NL) descriptions:

1. [NL description]
2. [NL description]
...
10. [NL description]

Each function should be generated in a single line, for a total of 10 lines.
Different instructions of the same function should be separated by the special character "\n".
Do not use empty lines to separate functions.

Here is an example of the format:
“Scan the tgtHost on tgtPort with nmap and calculate the state” is the natural language description.
"def nmapScan(tgtHost,tgtPort): \n nmScan = nmap.PortScanner() \n nmScan.scan(tgtHost,tgtPort) \n state=nmScan[tgtHost]['tcp'][int(tgtPort)]['state']\n" is the Python code.
