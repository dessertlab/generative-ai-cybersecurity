Generate Python functions corresponding to the following NL descriptions.

Generate the functions, one per line. The functions should be single-line, i.e., if there are multi-line instructions, they should be separated by the \n character. Do not use empty lines to separate the outputs. 

Here is an example of the format:
“Scan the tgtHost on tgtPort with nmap and calculate the state” is the natural language description.
"def nmapScan(tgtHost,tgtPort): \n nmScan = nmap.PortScanner() \n nmScan.scan(tgtHost,tgtPort) \n state=nmScan[tgtHost]['tcp'][int(tgtPort)]['state']\n" is the Python code.
